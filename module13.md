Module 13: Mapping in R 
====================

There are a lot of ways to create maps in R.  In fact, there are many different packages to choose from when it comes to making maps.  In this module, I will cover some of the basics with a few packages to give you an overview of the options.

There are also lots of tutorials online if you want more information.

## Large scale maps with polical boudaries (world, countries, counties)

Sometimes you want a very simple clean map with just a few polical boundries.   This is particularly useful for maps on a large scale (the world, the state, the county) to show where your study site is, but it's not so good if you want to show your particular sampling locations around a small pond.


### Simple maps using "maps" package

The simplist way to make a map is using the map() function in the "maps" package.  This package comes with map data for the countries of the world, US states, US counties, and a select few other country maps.


```r
library(maps)
# simple map of the world
map("world")

# add a point (roughly portland)
pdx_lat <- 45.52
pdx_lon <- -122.68
points(pdx_lon, pdx_lat, col = "red", pch = 20, cex = 1)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](figure/unnamed-chunk-11.png) 

```r

# If you want, you can zoom into the map by altering the xlim and ylim.
# Let's zooom in to the Pacific Northwest.
map("world", xlim = c(-130, -115), ylim = c(40, 50))
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1](figure/unnamed-chunk-12.png) 

```r

# Yick, the resolution isn't so hot.  Let's try using the state level maps.
map("state", region = c("Washington", "Oregon"))

# Add a point for Portland.
points(pdx_lon, pdx_lat, col = "red", pch = 20, cex = 3)

# Now let's add the counties to Oregon
map("county", "Oregon", add = T)
```

## Plotting Shapefiles

If you want to move beyond the limits of the maps packacke you'll want to be able to plot shapefiles.  If you are familiar with GIS you probably know what those are.  If not, just think of them as vectorized map files.

### Plotting a shapefile using "maptools" package


```r
library(maptools)
```

```
## Loading required package: sp
## Checking rgeos availability: FALSE
##  	Note: when rgeos is not available, polygon geometry 	computations in maptools depend on gpclib,
##  	which has a restricted licence. It is disabled by default;
##  	to enable gpclib, type gpclibPermit()
```

```r
## use readShapePoly to read a polygon shapefile.  Use readShapeLine for a
## line shapefile and readShapePoint for a points shapefile

# Countries of the world shapefile
countries <- readShapePoly("~/Geoprocessing_Shapefiles/Countries.shp")
# Marine Ecoregions of the World
MEOW <- readShapePoly("~/Geoprocessing_Shapefiles/meow_ecos.shp")

plot(MEOW, col = "light blue")
plot(countries, col = "gray", add = T)
```

### Plotting a shapefile using the "rgdal" package


```r

library(rgdal)
```

```
## rgdal: version: 0.8-16, (SVN revision 498)

```

```r
dsn <- path.expand("~/Geoprocessing_Shapefiles")
countries2 <- readOGR(dsn, "Countries")
```

```
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: "/home/stevesb/Geoprocessing_Shapefiles", layer: "Countries"
## with 250 features and 8 fields
## Feature type: wkbPolygon with 2 dimensions
```

```r
MEOW2 <- readOGR(dsn, "meow_ecos")
```

```
## OGR data source with driver: ESRI Shapefile 
## Source: "/home/stevesb/Geoprocessing_Shapefiles", layer: "meow_ecos"
## with 232 features and 9 fields
## Feature type: wkbPolygon with 2 dimensions
```

```r
plot(MEOW2, col = "gray")

## fill in the polygons black so you don't see the country borders
plot(countries2, col = "black", add = T)
```

Of course you could use specialized shapefiles at a much smaller scale if you wanted.


## Google Maps for terrain and satellite image based maps

Using Google Maps is a popular way to create a map using satellite imagery.  One of the first packages with this option was the "RgoogleMaps" package.  While it works just fine, I find it a bit clumsy to work with.  I currently prefer the mapping option in the "dismo" package. 

The dismo package by the way is also the package to use for *di*stribution *mo*delling (hence the name "dis mo").


```r
library(dismo)
```

```
## Loading required package: raster
```

```r

# Map of Oregon
OR_map <- gmap("Oregon", size = c(600, 600))
```

```
## Loading required package: XML
```

```r
plot(OR_map)
```
