Module 12: Version Control with Git 
====================

I don't have a module *per se* for this topic.  Rather, I'll point you to these links and then do a demonstration in class on Monday.

## Github

Github is a hosting site for GIT based programming repositories.  Think of it as an advanced Dropbox type site.

There are two basic options.. 

1. Free if you leave your repositories public
2. Pay monthly fee if you want your repositories private


I'm cheap, so I just leave my repositories open to the public, but I make sure that no sensitive data or information about passwords can be found in the repositories.

In fact, I've written all the code for these modules using R Markdown and all of my Rmd files can be found in the following github repository.

## Homework

I highly recommend everyone sign up for a free GitHub account.
